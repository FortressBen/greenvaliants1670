## Naming

 * Variables in Snake Case all lowercase
 * Constants in all caps and Snake Case
 * Functions are in Snake Case and lowercase

## Functions

 * use functions in place of variables for readability and repeatability as much as possible
 * nested functions: "If you need them, you need them" - Dave Cowden August 25, 2021 5:42 pm

## Spacing

 * One line blank after each function or loop
 * global and local variables do not get their own line between them
 * No spaces in names
 * indent = 4 spaces
 * dont do 4 spaces, just indent with tab

## Code Style 

 * don't use global variables unless the variable is used in multiple places
 * use dictionaries in place of long if/else branches
 * parameters are always defaulted
 * return something as much as possible for assert testing

## Other things

 * get rid of stars in imports
